        <h2>Method</h2>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 170C/150C Fan/Gas 3. Grease 6 x 20cm/8in loose
          bottom sandwich cake tins (approximately 4cm/1Â½in deep) and line the
          bottoms with greaseproof paper. Dust the tins with flour, then shake
          out the excess.
        </li>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Beat the butter and sugar together in a stand mixer until its fluffy
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the mixer to low speed and add the eggs bit by bit, mixing on
            high speed after each addition
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the vanilla, then add half of the flour. Mix until combined,
            then add the rest of the flour and mix until you have a smooth cake
            batter.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <li>
          Divide the batter equally between 6 medium-sized bowls and add dashes
          of each of the food colourings. Mix until you have a pink, yellow,
          orange, green, blue and purple batter. Pour each colour into one of
          the prepared tins and bake for approximately 25 minutes, turning after
          18 minutes so they colour evenly. Once baked, cool the cakes on a wire
          rack, then wrap in cling film and store in the fridge.
